### Gradually Rollout New Features in your Mobile App with IBM MobileFirst Foundation 8.0
Let’s say you are a marketing director of a global retailer, and you have an amazing idea about how to get more customers into your stores. Your kids have been enthusiastically playing the new Pokemon Go game, running around your neighborhood to collect augmented reality Pokemon, and you are impressed with how addictive the game is. It occurred to you that you could build a game around coupon collection modeled after Pokemon GO, in which customers would use your app to collect AR coupons in their surroundings, that they can then redeem in store. How cool! [Continue reading...]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/09/11/liveupdate-and-analytics/)

### Implementing Social Login Authentication with IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 8.0 - Part 1
Social Login has become a common authentication method in many mobile apps. App owners and users understand the big value it gives them. Users can now sign in to apps from their favorite social platform, such as Facebook or Google. This method makes life easier for the users, and also can give the app owner the ability to leverage the information from the social platform (for example, profile picture, users friends, feed, etc). App owners can maximize the user engagements with such capabilities. [Continue reading...]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/04/06/social-login-with-ibm-mobilefirst-platform-foundation/)

### Leverage Social Login In IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 8.0 - Part 2
Social Login by itself is good and gives values to app owners and users. In addition, you can leverage social login and get more value from it. Facebook, for example, lets you query their Graph API to get more contents such as user feeds, user friends, pictures. Some of the API requires additional permissions from the user, but sometimes basic info like profile picture is enough from the app users.

### Add trusted devices with IBM MobileFirst Foundation 8.0
Many of the apps you use every day, like your favorite chat and email apps, are available to you in multiple channels - like web and mobile. And you probably appreciate it if you can transition seamlessly between the two, even when it comes to authentication. Entering your credentials over and over on each device can be frustrating. What if your browser could somehow know that you already authenticated in your mobile app? [Continue reading...]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/07/31/add-trusted-device/)

### Implementing SMS One-Time-Password Authentication with IBM MobileFirst Foundation 8.0
SMS One-Time-Password(OTP) is essential authentication method in every modern mobile application. SMS authentication and/or number verification gives your app good balance between security and user experience. More and more retails and banking apps use this method as their main authentication method. [Continue reading...]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/07/18/sms-otp-with-ibm-mobilefirst-foundation/)

### Working with LDAP and LTPA in IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 8.0
The ability to connect an application to a user registry is an important ability. You might want your users to be able to connect to your back-end systems with the same credentials that they use to connect to other resources in the enterprise, or you just need to connect the user to the registry. LDAP is an established protocol for connecting to a user registry. [Continue reading...]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/04/21/using-ldap-as-user-registry/)

### Implementing License Agreement Signature using MobileFirst Foundation 8.0
With MobileFirst Foundation it is fairly straight forward to develop this functionality and make sure it is enforced. The security framework provides the infrastructure to orchestrate sending the license agreement only to users who haven't signed it, and resend when it changes. You can also update the terms & conditions remotely from the Foundation console, and make sure your users sign the new version, without any downtime or code changes.
