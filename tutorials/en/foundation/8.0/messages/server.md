| **Error Code**  | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **FWLSE3000E:** | **A server error was detected.** |
| **FWLSE3001E:** | **A conflict was detected.** |
| **FWLSE3002E:** | **The resource is not found.** |
| **FWLSE3003E:** | **The runtime cannot be added since its payload contains no name.** |
| **FWLSE3010E:** | **A database error was detected.** <br/><br/>How to reproduuce: Difficult. In theory, misconfigure the data base. |
| **FWLSE3011E:** | **The port number "{0}" of the mfp.admin.proxy.port JNDI property is not valid.** <br/><br/>{0} is the port number, e.g. 9080.<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, set JNDI property mfp.admin.proxy.port to a nonsense value.  Then open the Operations Console. The message will eventually appear in the server logs. |
| **FWLSE3012E:** | **JMX connection error. Reason: "{0}". Check the application server logs for details.** <br/><br/>{0} is an error message coming from the JMX protocol of the web server.<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, misconfigure JMX somehow that it throws exceptions. |
| **FWLSE3013E:** | **Timeout when trying to obtain the transaction lock after {0} milliseconds.** <br/><br/>{0} is the number of milliseconds, for instance 32000.<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, this happens with a data base connected through an unstable or slow network. |

| **FWLSE3018E:** | **Cloudant operation did not complete within {0} milliseconds.** <br/><br/>{0} is the number of milliseconds, for instance 32000.<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, use Cloudant DB and set JNDI property mfp.db.cloudant.documentOperation.timeout to 1. If the connection to cloudant is slow, open the Operations Console. The message will eventually appear in the server logs. |
| **FWLSE3019E:** | **Unable to obtain transaction lock. Reason: {0}** <br/><br/>{0} is some exception message that we returned from external. Can be any string.  <br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, can be reproduced when you have a farm with Cloudant and you shut down the locking master while a locking operations is ongoing. Then open the Operations Console.  The message will eventually appear in the server logs. |
| **FWLSE3021E:** | **Timeout when trying to obtain the transaction lock after {0} milliseconds. Increase the {1} property.**<br/><br/>{0} is the number of milliseconds, for instance 32000.<br/>{1} is the name of the JNDI property from which the timeout is taken.<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, this happens with a data base connected through an unstable or slow network. |

| **FWLSE3199I:** | **========= {0} version {1} started.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: This occurs always in the server log when the server started. |
| **FWLSE3210W:** | **Environment: {1} of application {0} version {2} has been deployed with a different version of the native MobileFirst SDK. Direct updates will no longer be available for existing clients with other versions of the MobileFirst SDK. To continue to use direct updates, increment the app version, publish it to the public app store, deploy to the server, and (optionally) block/notify older versions of the app to enforce customers to upgrade to the new version from the app store.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, this may occur if an app was created by an older version of MobileFirst Studio with a different, older MobileFirst SDK. But I am not familiar with native MobileFirst SDK versions. |

| **FWLSE3123W:** | **Environment: {1} of application {0} version {2} has been deployed with extended application authenticity disabled. It is recommended to to use extended app authenticity to further protect from unauthorized apps by using the enable extended-authenticity command of the mfpadm tool before deploying the application.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: In Operations Console, deploy an app with basic authenticity. All apps prior to 7.0 have no extended authenticity and should show this warning or the next. The warning does not occur if you use the Operations Console that is embedded in Worklight Studio. |
| **FWLSE3124W:** | **Environment: {1} of application {0} version {2} has been deployed with application authenticity disabled. Enable it to further protect from unauthorized apps.** |

| **FWLSE3200W:** | **The server "{0}" cannot be added as a new farm member because a server with the same ID is already registered for the runtime "{1}". This can happen either if the JNDI property mfp.admin.serverid has the same value on another running node, or if your server did not unregister itself properly when it last shut down.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, this happens if you configure a server farm wrongly. A server farm consists of multiple computers (nodes). Each computer must have an id (JNDI property mfp.admin.serverid).  If you use the exact same id for two different nodes, you would see this message in the server log. |
| **FWLSE3201E:** | **Failed to unregister the farm member "{0}" for runtime "{1}".**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, may occur in the server logs if you have a server farm and shut down one node in the farm, and anything went wrong during the shutdown. |
| **FWLSE3202E:** | **Failed to retrieve the list of farm members for server "{0}".**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, may occur in the server logs when the admin service is shut down in a server farm.  It then tries to notify the farm members and needs a list of farm members for that. |
| **FWLSE3203E:** | **No farm node is registered with server id "{0}" for runtime "{1}".** |
| **FWLSE3204W:** | **Node "{0}" seems unreachable, this transaction was not performed on this node.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, this can occur in a server farm if you disconnect one farm node from the network and wait long enough. It appears in the server log. |
| **FWLSE3205W:** | **Unable to put the runtime "{0}" on server "{1}" in denial of service mode. You can ignore this warning if the runtime is also shutting down.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, this can occur in a server farm if you disconnect one farm node from the network and wait long enough or shut down the server. But additionally to the normal processing, another exception must happen (e.g. an OutOfMemory exception). |
| **FWLSE3206E:** | **Not allowed to unregister the server "{0}" for the runtime "{1}" because the server appears to be still alive.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, you could reproduce this by calling the REST API to remove a farm node while this farm node is still running. |
| **FWLSE3207E:** | **The farm member with server id "{0}" is not reachable. Please try again later.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. In theory, this can occur in a server farm if you disconnect one farm node from the network and then try to deploy a wlapp. The transaction will fail and you can then see this message in the error log (transaction log, accessible though the UI). |
| **FWLSE3208E:** | **An invalid status code "{0}" was returned. The response content is "{1}".**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: This can occur whenever an unexpected status code is returned from a config service REST invocation. |
| **FWLSE3209E:** | **An exception has occurred during configuration service invocation. The exception message is "{0}".**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: This can occur whenever there are problems with CRUD operations dealing with configurations in the configuration service. This exection is generic and wraps multiple errors |
| **FWLSE3210E:** | **The resource(s) {0} that you are trying to export is not found.** |
| **FWLSE3211E:** | **The resourceInfos parameter {0} is specified incorrectly. The parameter needs to have a value in the format resourceName||resourceType.** |

| **FWLSE3301E:** | **Problem with SSL certificates. Possible fixes: Put the application server''s certificate into the truststore. Or define the JNDI property {0} to {1} (not in production environments).**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Difficult. Occurs if you setup the server with SSL, but use a wrong SSL certificate. Can also occur with self-signed certificates under certain circumstances. |
| **FWLSE3302E:** | **The keystore for the runtime "{0}" does not exist in the MobileFirst administration database. The database may be corrupted.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: if keystore not present |
| **FWLSE3303E:** | **The Application name "{0}", Environment "{1}", and Version "{2}" from the Web Resource/Authenticity data does not match the deployed application.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Upload a web resource generated for a different application |
| **FWLSE3304E:** | **JNDI property "{0}" is not set. Push service is not enabled in this server.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: Give incorrect push server url |
| **FWLSE3305E:** | **Keystore alias can not be null.**<br/><br/>How to reproduce: try to upload a keystore and skip the password and alias fields. |
