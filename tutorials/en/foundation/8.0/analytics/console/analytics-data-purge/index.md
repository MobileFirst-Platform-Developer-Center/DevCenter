## Overview

Analytics data is stored on the server and is available for reporting until the data is purged. You can control which event-type data is retained or purged. The data can be purged at regular intervals, or manually.


## Configuring data retention from the Analytics Console

1. From the Analytics Console, click the Administration icon (<img  alt="wrench icon" style="margin:0;display:inline" src="wrench.png"/>).
2. Choose the **Settings** tab.
