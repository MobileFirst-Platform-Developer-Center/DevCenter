## Overview
This tutorial explains the steps a developer needs to follow in order to develop and test iOS applications. These steps include registering at Apple Developer and installing Xcode.

#### Support level

* Xcode 7.1 and later
* iOS 8 and later

**Prerequisite:** As you setup your iOS development environment, make sure to also read the [Setting up the MobileFirst development environment](../mobilefirst/) tutorial.

### Registration
1. Register as an iOS developer
 - [Create an Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account) to be used by your organization/team admin.
 - Using the Apple ID, sign-in to the [Apple Developer Member Center](https://developer.apple.com/).
2. Inside the Member Center > Programs &amp; Add-ons section register for the appropriate program for your organization

### Development
To develop either Cordova or Native iOS applications, a [Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/) workstation needs to be used with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.

Xcode provides with it the tools and APIs required to develop applications for the iOS platform, using either Objective-C or Swift programming languages.</p>

Xcode is an IDE which you can use to:

- Manage your test devices
- Use the iOS simulator
- Install apps on iOS devices
- Develop, debug, test performance, and more

> To learn more, [visit the iOS Developer Library website](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/)

#### iOS Simulator
Xcode provides an iOS Simulator to test your application. For a detailed explanation of all available options, see the [About Simulator documentation topic](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html) in the Apple Developers website.

## What's Next
Now that the MobileFirst and iOS development environment are set up, continue to [Quick Start](../../../quick-start/ios/) category to experience MobileFirst Platform, or to [All Tutorials](../../../all-tutorials) to learn specific aspects of MobileFirst Platform development.
