<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation provides a unified set of API methods to send, or push, notifications to devices where the MobileFirst application is installed in. It is possible to send a notification in 3 distinct types: event source notifications, broadcast notifications, and tag-base notifications.</p>
<p>This tutorial explains the concept, API, and usage of push notifications in the context of hybrid applications.<br />

<h2 id="whatIsPushNotifications">What is push notification?</h2>
<p>Push notifications is the ability of a mobile device to receive messages that are "pushed" from a server.</p>
<p>Notifications are received regardless of whether the application is currently running.<br />
Notifications can take several forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alert (all)</strong>: A pop-up text message</li>
<li><strong>Badge (iOS), Tile (W8, WP8)</strong>: A graphical representation that allows a short text or image</li>
<li><strong>Banner (iOS), Toast (W8, WP8)</strong>: A disappearing pop-up text message at the top of the device display</li>
<li><strong>Sound (all)</strong>: A sound file playing when a notification is received</li>
<li><strong>Interactive (iOS 8)</strong>: Action buttons inside the <strong>Banner</strong> of a received notification</li>
</ul>
<h3>Device support</h3>
<p>Push notifications are supported for the following mobile platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android 2.3.5, 4.x, 5.x</li>
<li>iOS 6, 7, and 8</li>
<li>Windows Phone 8.x</li>
<li>Windows 8</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additionalNotificationTypes">Notification types</h2>
<h3>Event source notifications</h3>
<p>Event source notifications are notification messages that are targeted to devices with a user subscription.</p>
<h3>Broadcast notifications</h3>
<p>Broadcast notifications are notification messages that are targeted to all subscribed devices.</p>
<h3>Tag notifications</h3>
<p>Tag notifications are notification messages that are targeted to all the devices that are subscribed to a particular tag.</p>
<p>For more information, <a href="#selectNotificationType">select a notification type</a>.</p>
<h2 id="projectSetupAndGuidelines">Project setup and guidelines</h2>
<p>You set up push notification differently depending on the platform that you use.</p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<p>To send push notifications to Android devices, use the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service.<br />
To register to the GCM service, you need a valid Gmail account.</p>
<p>For more information about how to get a GCM Project Number and API key (which you use later in the MobileFirst project), see <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you create an API key, make sure that the type is <strong>server key</strong>.</li>
<li>Android OS 2.3.5 devices must be synchronized with a Gmail account.</li>
<li>Android OS 4.x devices do not impose Gmail account synchronization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>iOS</h3>
<p>To send push notifications to iOS devices, use the Apple Push Notifications Service (APNS).<br />
You must be a registered Apple iOS Developer to obtain an APNS certificate for your application. <em>APNS certificates must have a non-blank password.</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the development phase, use the <code>apns-certificate-sandbox.p12</code> sandbox certificate file and place it in the environment root folder or in the application root folder. The environment root folder takes the highest priority.</li>
<li>During a production phase, use the <code>apns-certificate-production.p12</code> production certificate file and place it in the environment root folder or in the application root folder. The environment root folder takes the highest priority.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the hybrid application has both iPhone and iPad environments, it requires separate certificates for push notification for each environment. In that case, place those certificates in the corresponding environment folders.</p>
<h3>Windows Phone 8</h3>
<p>To send push notifications to Windows Phone 8 devices, use the Microsoft Push Notifications Service (MPNS).</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-authenticated push notification does not require any setup from the developer. Authenticated push notification requires a Windows Phone Dev Center account.</li>
<li>To use authenticated push, you must use a certificate that is issued by a Microsoft-trusted root certificate authority.<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> For production, consider using authenticated push notification in order to ensure that the information is not compromised.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows 8</h3>
<p>To send push notifications to Windows 8 devices, use Windows Push Notification Services (WNS).<br />
As a developer, you need to register your app with Windows Store through the Windows Dev Center by using your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>For more information about how to get WNS credentials (which you use later in the MobileFirst project), see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/windows/apps/hh465407.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/windows/apps/hh465407.aspx</a></p>
<h4>For push notification to be sent, the following servers must be accessible from a MobileFirst Server instance:</h4>
<p><strong>iOS</strong><br />
<u>Sandbox servers:</u><br />
gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195<br />
feedback.sandbox.push.apple.com:2196</p>
<p><u>Production servers:</u><br />
gateway.push.apple.com:2195<br />
Feedback.push.apple.com:2196</p>
<p>1-courier.push.apple.com 5223</p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<p>If your organization has a firewall that restricts the traffic to or from the Internet, you must do the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure the firewall to allow connectivity with GCM in order for your GCM client apps to receive messages. The ports to open are 5228, 5229, and 5230. GCM typically uses only 5228, but it sometimes uses 5229 and 5230. GCM does not provide specific IP, so you must allow your firewall to accept outgoing connections to all IP addresses contained in the IP blocks listed in Google ASN of 15169. For more information, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/http">Implementing an HTTP Connection Server</a>.</li>
<li>Ensure that your firewall accepts outgoing connections from MobileFirst Server to <code>android.googleapis.com</code> on port 443.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows Phone 8</h3>
<p>No specific port needs to be open in your server configuration.<br />
MPNS uses regular http or https requests.</p>
<h3>Windows 8</h3>
<p>No specific port needs to be open in your server configuration.<br />
WNS uses regular http or https requests.</p>
<h2 id="projconfig">Project configuration</h2>
<p>To set up push notifications in an application, add the following lines to the <code>application-descriptor.xml</code> file.<br />
You can also edit these settings with the Application Descriptor Editor in Design mode.</p>
