<h2>Overview</h2>
Broadcast notification are in fact tag-based notification, where a subscription to a reserved tag, Push.ALL, is auto-created for every device. Broadcast notifications are thus notification messages that are targeted to all subscribed devices.

Broadcast notifications are enabled by default for any push-enabled MobileFirst application.
This ability can be disabled by unsubscribing the device from the reserved Push.ALL tag.

<blockquote>For more information about broadcast notification, see the topics about broadcast notification topic in the user documentation.</blockquote>

<h2>Common API methods for tag-based and broadcast notifications</h2>
<h4>Client-side API:</h4>

When a notification is received by a device, the <code>didReceiveRemoteNotification</code> method in the app delegate is called. The logic to handle the notification should be defined here.

{% highlight objc linenos %} 
-(void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo{
    NSLog(@"Received Notification %@",userInfo.description);
}
{% endhighlight %} 

<ul>
    <li>userInfo - A JSON block that contains the payload field. This field holds other data that is sent from the MobileFirst Platform server. It also contains the tag name for tag and broadcast notification. The tag name appears in the tag element. For broadcast notification, the default tag name is <code>Push.ALL</code>.</li>
</ul>

{% highlight objc linenos %} 
[[WLPush sharedInstance] setOnReadyToSubscribeListener:readyToSubscribeListener];
{% endhighlight %} 
<ul>
<li>This method registers a listener to be used for push notifications. This listener should implement the OnReadyToSubscribe() method.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Server-side API</h4>
<ul>
    <li><code>WL.Server.sendMessage(applicationId,notificationOptions)</code>
    This method submits a notification based on the specified target parameters and takes two mandatory parameters:
        <ul>
           <li><code>applicationId</code> - (mandatory) The name of the MobileFirst application</li>
            <li><code>notificationOptions</code> - (mandatory) A JSON block containing message properties</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>For a full list of message properties, refer to the <code>WL.Server.sendMessage</code> API in the API reference documentation.</blockquote>

<h2>Sample application</h2>
Before running the application, check the adapter's <code>PushAdapter-impl.js</code> file and verify that the <code>WL.Server.sendMessage()</code> method  use the correct application name. The correct application name can be determined from the <code>id</code> attribute in <code>application-descriptor.xml</code>.
