## Introduction
IBMÂ® Security Access Manager can be used in the DMZ to protect MobileFirst mobile application traffic.

It can be used as a security gateway to protect mobile application traffic initiated by MobileFirst application. Such traffic can be protected by preventing data from being altered, authenticating users and allowing only authorised users to access the enterprise applications.

IBM Security Access Manager can be used in different ways within an organisation's network to protect enterprise resources. It can be placed in the DMZ so that it acts as a front-end, reverse proxy and a security gateway.

> This article assumes prior knowledge of other MobileFirst features, such as challenge handlers. It also assumes that IBM Security Access Manager is installed and IBM Security Access Manager for Web configured and Reverse Proxy Instance created.

## Supported versions
This pattern and the samples are designed to work  MobileFirst Platform Foundation 8.0. The supported platforms currently are Android, iOS and Cordova.

This also requires MobileFirst to run on an application server that supports LTPA tokens.

> NOTE: Android is supported on IBM Security Access Manager version 9.0.2 onwards. The older versions of Security Access Manager tokenise the authentication header, causing the MobileFirst Platform Foundation's Android SDK to fail. Cordova and iOS SDKs are not affected by this. This issue has been rectified in IBM Security Access Manager 9.0.2.

## Setting up your MobileFirst application
Create your MobileFirst application without any security, to ensure that it works without IBM Security Access Manager.

> You can download the linked samples for Cordova, Android or iOS.

### Challenge Handler
The IBM Security Access Manager pattern provided here will send an HTML login form when the MobileFirst application tries to access any protected resource. To detect the incoming login form, `GatewayChallengeHandler` is used in conjunction with searching for the known login form string `pkmslogin.form`. IBM Security Access Manager expects that the login form is submitted with the login credentials of the user accessing protected resources.

#### Cordova and Android App:
- The form's action URL, relative to MobileFirst context is `../../../../../../../pkmslogin.form?token=Unknown`.

#### iOS App:
- The form's action URL, relative to MobileFirst context is `../../pkmslogin.form?token=Unknown`.

#### Common For All Mobile platforms
- The form submitted back to IBM Security Access Manager expects 3 elements as parameters.
  - `username`
  - `password`
  - `login-form-type = pwd` (This is the hard coded element of the login form).

Below is the example for Cordova applications.

Declare the challenge handler. The name of the security check parameter is not important:

```js
var isamAuthChallengeHandler = WL.Client.createGatewayChallengeHandler("LtpaBasedSSO");
```

`canHandleResponse` need to be implemented, which helps determine if the current HTTP response is relevant for the challenge handler. In this case, we look for `pkmslogin.form`.

```js
isamAuthChallengeHandler.canHandleResponse = function(response) {
  if (!response || response.responseText === null) {
    return false;
  }
  var indicatorIdx = response.responseText.search('pkmslogin.form');
  if (indicatorIdx >= 0) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
};
```

`handleResponse` will be called when `canHandleResponse` returns `true`. We can put in the code to display the login form here.

Once the user fills in the login form, clicking **Submit** button should trigger `submitLoginForm`, passing the user credentials as parameters.

```js
document.getElementById("AuthSubmitButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
  var reqURL = '../../../../../../../pkmslogin.form?token=Unknown';
  var options = {};
  options.parameters = {
    'username' : document.getElementById('AuthUsername').value,
    'password' : document.getElementById('AuthPassword').value,
    'login-form-type' : 'pwd'
  };

  isamAuthChallengeHandler.submitLoginForm(reqURL, options,
     isamAuthChallengeHandler.submitLoginFormCallback);
});
```

MobileFirst framework will call `submitLoginFormCallback` when a response is received by the application. In the callback function, we check if the response is a valid response and call `submitSuccess` to complete the authentication process.

```js
isamAuthChallengeHandler.submitLoginFormCallback = function(response) {
  var isLoginFormResponse = isamAuthChallengeHandler.canHandleResponse(response);
  if (isLoginFormResponse) {
    isamAuthChallengeHandler.handleChallenge(response);
  } else {
    document.getElementById('result').style.display = 'block';
    document.getElementById('auth').style.display = 'none';
    isamAuthChallengeHandler.submitSuccess();
  }
};
```

Clicking the **Logout** button will log the user out of the MobileFirst server, first, and then will logout the user from IBM Security Access Manager. For logging out of IBM Security Access Manager, the action URL is `../../../../../../../pkmslogout`.
> It will be `../../pkmslogout` for iOS applications.

```js
document.getElementById('logout').addEventListener('click', function() {
  WLAuthorizationManager.logout("LtpaBasedSSO").then(
    function() {
      var reqURL = '../../../../../../../pkmslogout';
      var options = {};
      options.parameters = {};

      isamAuthChallengeHandler.submitLoginForm(reqURL, options, null);
      alert ("Success logout");
    },
    function(response) {
      WL.Logger.debug("logout onFailure" + JSON.stringify(response));
    });
});
```

## Scope-Elements Mapping
IBM Security Access Manager is responsible for authentication and communicates the status with MobileFirst server using LTPA tokens. To ensure requests with valid LTPA token access protected resources, such resources need to be protected by the security check `LtpaBasedSSO`.

One way to achieve this is to map the **Scope-Elements** on this application. This will ensure that each application trying to access the protected resource is subjected to LTPA validation first.

In the MobileFirst Console, select your application and then click **Security** tab. Look for **Scope-Elements Mapping**. Click **New** and enter `accessRestricted` for **Scope Element**. Choose `LtpaBasedSSO` as **Predefined MobileFirst Security Checks**.

>**Note:** `accessRestricted` is used in this example. It can be something else for your resource.


### server.xml
In MobileFirst server, look for *ltpa.keys* file. Fill in the value for `com.ibm.websphere.ltpa.Realm` in the file.

In the *server.xml* file, look for `<basicRegistry>` or `<ldapRegsitry>` element. Create one, if it does not exist. Add `realm` attribute to that element. The value for the `realm` attribute should be the one that you had filled in *ltpa.keys* file above.

When using `<basicRegistry>`, ensure that the authorised users are also listed here.

```xml
<basicRegistry realm="worklightRealm">
  ...
  <user name="cn=JaneDoe,dc=iswga" password="Passw0rd1"/>
  <user name="cn=JohnDoe,dc=iswga" password="Passw0rd2"/>
</basicRegistry>
```

> NOTE: If application server is configured for `<ldapRegsitry>`, either the same or replica of same LDAP server need to be used that was configured with IBM Security Access Manager. This is because the DNs of the users need to match, for the SSO to work.

For more information about basic registry or configuring against LDAP server, refer your application server's documentation.
