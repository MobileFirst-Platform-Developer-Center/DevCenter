Late last year, [Microsoft released two mobiles](http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9700462/microsoft-lumia-950-launch-release-date) - the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL phones that came pre-loaded with Windows 10 Mobile. These mobiles came with Windows 10 Build 10.0.10586. 

Recently, we validated our existing versions of IBM MobileFirst against Windows 10 Mobile. Our validation was done on a Lumia 535 device running the Windows 10 build 10.0.10586.63. As usual, we run through the whole gamut of IBM MobileFirst functionality on the new operating system and are happy to announce support for Windows 10 Mobile on IBM MobileFirst 6.3, 7.0 and 7.1. 

Both hybrid and native apps were validated. In addition, we also validated both Windows Silverlight applications (windowsphone8 environment in IBM MobileFirst) and Windows 8 Universal applications (windowsphone8universal environment in IBM MobileFirst) during this process. Support for Windows 10 UWP applications is not yet available in IBM MobileFirst. Therefore, only your MobileFirst apps for Silverlight or Windows Phone 8 Universal apps will work on Windows 10 Mobile devices.
