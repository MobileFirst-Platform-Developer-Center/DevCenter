Apple has released a new beta version for [10.3](https://developer.apple.com/news/).Of all the new changes and additional features, iOS 10.3 uses new [Apple File System (APFS)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/701/) for faster updates and smarter backups.

### What does it mean for IBM MobileFirst Platform customers and developers

All the major features such as authentication, JSONStore, app management capabilities, server connectivity and adapter invocation/chaining, push notifications, Cordova plug-ins, native pages, common UI controls, direct update and  native elements in hybrid pages all work as expected.

Advanced device security features such as App Authenticity, Device Provisioning, and others work as expected.

All the features of IBM MobileFirst Platform v7.1 and v8.0 work as expected. Existing apps when upgraded to iOS 10.3 work seamlessly.
