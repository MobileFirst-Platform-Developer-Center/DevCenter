IBM plans to provide service updates to IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.1 and IBM MobileFirst Foundation 8.0 (either on-perm or MobileFirst Foundation Bluemix service) to support the next Android and iOS releases based on the terms described in [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045489](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045489). Note that this policy is not dictated by the Program Technical Support's lifecycle as stated in the product's version announce letter, because a new version of a supported mobile operating system is considered a new feature. In other words, we do not plan to introduce support for the next Android and iOS releases in IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.0 or earlier releases.

For those of you who have Android or iOS apps developed using IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.0 or earlier releases, and intend to have your app(s) running on the next Android or iOS version, you'll have to upgrade to IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.1 or IBM MobileFirst Foundation 8.0.

Talk to your IBM representative about how we can help.
